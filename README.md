# Project: Movie Recommender
For this project, I implement a simple movie recommender that makes recommendations to a given user based on what "similar" users liked in the past. 
Such approach is called collaborative filtering. Different algorithms can be used to compute similarity between a pair of users given their movie ratings. 
We will use Pearson correlation. I store movie ratings data in a custom data structure built using linked lists.
